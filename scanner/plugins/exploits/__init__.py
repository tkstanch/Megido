Exploit Plugins

This directory contains exploit plugin implementations for various vulnerability types.
Each plugin implements the ExploitPlugin interface and provides exploit capabilities
for a specific vulnerability type.

Available Plugins:
- sqli_plugin.py: SQL Injection exploit plugin with support for multiple databases

To add a new plugin:
1. Create a new Python file in this directory (e.g., xss_plugin.py)
2. Import the ExploitPlugin base class
3. Create a class that inherits from ExploitPlugin
4. Implement all required methods (vulnerability_type, name, description, 
   generate_payloads, execute_attack)
5. The plugin will be automatically discovered and loaded by the PluginRegistry
