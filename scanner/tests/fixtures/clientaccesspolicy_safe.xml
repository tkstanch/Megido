<!-- Example restrictive Silverlight client access policy.
     Used as a test fixture for the SilverlightClientAccessDetectorPlugin.

     This policy is well-configured:
       - Only an explicit, known domain is trusted.
       - Only specific request headers are permitted.
       - No wildcards.
